description: How to use the Accessibility Insights browser extension

## Background

[Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/en/) is an incredibly powerful tool actually created by Microsoft. This is the entire reason Chrome is the browser I recommend for the majority of accessibility testing. It is powered by [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core), which is the same auditing library leveraged in [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse).

We'll use it to verify tab order and run in-depth assessments of pages. This extension offers really solid scaffolding to walk you through the manual testing that is absolutely vital to determining whether a page is accessible.

## Functionality

To use the extension, you can click the browser extension icon or use the keyboard shortcut (`Shift + Command + K` for Mac, `Control + Shift + K` for Windows).
As soon as you activate the extension, you'll see some options pop down from the extenstions toolbar in Chrome.

### FastPass

This essentially runs the same audit that Lighthouse does, looking for the types of violations that can be automatically detected.

### Assessment

This is the feature that makes this tool truly shine. If selected, it will open a brand new Chrome window with a list of steps on the left and instructions to follow to verify the accessibility of the current page.
The very first thing that it does is to run the automated checks that would be run with the FastPass option.
Then, it runs through sections of WCAG and walks you through verification that there are no accessibility violations. It groups these steps in a slightly different order than presented in the WCAG, but is effective in guiding you in how to test and draw conclusions.
If you follow all of the steps and mark pass/fail, this generates results that you can export. I recommend doing a full audit of [x page?], exporting the results, and using them when creating issues and PRs.
