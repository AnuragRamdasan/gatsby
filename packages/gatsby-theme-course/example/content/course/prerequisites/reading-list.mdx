Gatsby has a commitment to accessibility, which is demonstrated in our [Accessibility Statement](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/accessibility-statement/). Please take the time to read through the following to establish some background knowledge and prepare you to deliver on this commitment in your day-to-day.

## Accessibility Background

### WebAIM

[WebAIM](https://webaim.org/) has put together a lot of resources that are incredibly useful. I highly recommend going down a link rabbit hole within their site. deque

- WebAIM's [user perspective article](https://webaim.org/articles/userperspective/) outlines common disabilities, problems that people with those disabilities face when using the web, and ways we can mitigate those issues.
- [The WebAIM Screen Reader User Survey](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey8/) shows how people use screen readers and the types of problems they run into
- The [WebAIM Million](https://webaim.org/projects/million/) shows the state of accessibility for the top million front pages of the web

### deque

[deque](https://www.deque.com/) has a lot of very helpful resources as well. They wrote the open source library ([axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core)) that backs most automated auditing software, including [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse). They also have guides and training for developing for accessibility. I especially recommend checking out some of their webinars.

- [How persons with disabilities use the web](https://accessibility.deque.com/on-demand-how-persons-with-disabilities-use-the-web) is an incredible panel discussion covering personal use cases. This helps build empathy and understanding around how assistive technologies are helpful and the problems they both solve and run into.
