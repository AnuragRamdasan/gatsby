## Welcome!

Let's quickly go over what this course aims to accomplish, what you can expect to learn, and what this course won't cover.
By design, this is going to be very opinionated and scoped down in order to give you the best foundation to applying accessibility principles to your day-to-day work.

### Structure

1. **Prerequisites**: These are steps I'd like you to complete on your own time before we meet. These are things like programs I'd like you to have already installed on your computer and articles I'd like you to be familiar with.
1. **Delivery**: I'll meet with small groups of you to talk through concepts, tools, and processes knowing that you've already built a baseline understanding of why we care about accessibility and the types of issues people with disabilities experience when using the web.
1. **Resources**: I'll make sure that you are equipped to incorporate accessibility into your day-to-day and leave you with a host of resources that you can refer to and use to expand your knowledge beyond our limited synchronous time together.

### Scoping

The content for the "delivery" portion of the course is going to be very focused on specific tools and workflows that will allow you to determine whether a component is accessible or not and take steps to address any accessibility violations that you identify. I am purposefully focusing on a few manual testing workflows and while I'll leave you with a list of more thorough methods and advanced patterns and practices, I want to provide you with a more pared down toolbox to minimize any overwhelm around resource overload. You'll learn about the limitations of different tools and types of tests and hopefully build up a good intuition around which resources to lean on for specific types of questions.
