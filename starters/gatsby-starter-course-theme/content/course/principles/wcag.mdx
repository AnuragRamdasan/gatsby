One thing that's sure to come up when talking about web accessibility is **"compliance"**. We usually frame this around laws like the American Disabilities Act (ADA) and around the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
While this is a really dry way to look at things and can quickly become overwhelming, it is important to mention as a great place to start and a tremendous resource.

WCAG (often pronounced "wuh-cag") outlines the [set of criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) a website must pass in order to be considered accessible. These standards are developed by [The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C))](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/) through its [Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/). It works closely with the community to establish web standards for content, tools, user agents, and also create the [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) specification.

There have been several versions of WCAG. The latest stable version is 2.1 (released June 5, 2018) and 2.2 is already in development. Versions are designed to be backwards compatible, so if you aim to meet both 2.0 and 2.1, you can refer solely to the documentation for 2.1.
Within each version there are different levels of success criteria:

- A
- AA
- AAA
