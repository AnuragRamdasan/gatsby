Let's kick off our synchronous session by talking about the fundamentals of accessibility and the mindset we need to adopt in order to give users the best experience with the things we build.

## Exercise

Please fill out: [LINK TO THING] collaborative document/slide/?

**Questions**:

1. How do you approach accessibility in your day-to-day work?
1. What do you need to know in order to make sure your work is accessible?

I anticipate the answers to these falling into three main categories:

1. Missing knowledge
1. Processes/Tools I don't know about
1. Too many decisions to know if I'm doing things the _right_ way
